# excel-comparison
This software will be able to compare separate excel documents together and give you percent averages. I plan to put this to use in my restuarnt to more effectively conclude sales and produce for the restaurant. This program could also average server and bartender checkouts across multiple excel documents. https://github.com/ksu-is/excel-comparison
